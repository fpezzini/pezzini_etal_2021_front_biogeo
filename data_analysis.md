# Comparing models in Bayesian analysis 

I have followed Condamine et al. 2015.

The most suitable model can be selected by comparing the Bayes Factor (BF). 
The BF is equal to the ratio of the Marginal Likelihood Estimate (MLE) of two models (`BF=MLE1/MLE2`) or 
to the difference of MLEs in log space (`log(BF)=log(MLE1) â€“ log(MLE2)`). 

Positive values of BF would favour MLE1, and different values have different strengths. 
Values above five indicates that one model is significantly favoured over the other (Kass and Raftery 1995, Condamine et al. 2015), 
values above 20 indicate strong support and values above 150 overwhelming support.

## How to calculate the Marginal Likelihood?

https://www.beast2.org/model-comparison/ 

I used the Nested Sampling algorithm (Skilling 2006) implemented in the NS package version 1.0.4 (Russel et al. 2019) for BEAST2 version 2.5.1 
with 60 particles and 10,000 chain length. The NS package also calculates **the standard deviation (SD)** of the estimated Marginal Likelihood, 
which **allows us to have confidence in the BF values calculated**.

A tutorial for this package can be found here: https://taming-the-beast.org/tutorials/NS-tutorial/
